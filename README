My thesis project files.

I'm trying to find out which companies/people are associated with which tech trends on the Web. The tool I'm trying to make work is to be able to extract NEs and trends from a document.

Like: NE "Google" in the context of "Robotics".

So, having a corpus of tech blog posts with timestamps one will be able to find out which company does something in some field at a given period of time. Poo-tee-weet?
